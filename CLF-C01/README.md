# CLF-C01
I didn't study much for this one, and in fact booked the test on a lark 48 hours
 in advance. I passed the test on the first try (836/1000) without much studying.  
 Going into the exam, I had a cursory knowledge of most AWS components.

The studying I did do boiled down to maybe 2-3 hours of practice test review,
 along with some review of others' scrap notes.
